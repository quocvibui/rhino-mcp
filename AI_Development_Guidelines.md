# AI Development Guidelines
## Core Principle
Follow STYLE.md strictly. Keep code pure, concise, and human-readable.
## Code Philosophy
- **No fluff**: No emojis, icons, or decorative elements in code/comments/output
- **Simplicity first**: Start with the simplest solution that works
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Readable code beats compact tricks
- **Minimal abstractions**: Don't over-engineer or add unnecessary layers
## Communication Style
- Be direct and concise
- No unnecessary pleasantries or verbose explanations
- Get to the point
- No emojis or special characters in any output
## Code Generation Rules
- Follow STYLE.md exactly (tabs, naming, line length, docstrings)
- Functions do one thing well
- Avoid deep nesting - flatten logic when possible
- No magic numbers - use named constants
- Error messages: plain text, describe what went wrong
## What to Avoid
- Emojis, icons, decorative comments
- Over-commenting obvious code
- Premature optimization
- Unnecessary classes/inheritance
- Verbose variable names when context is clear
- Framework overkill for simple tasks
## What to Do
- Write self-documenting code
- Use clear, direct names
- Keep it minimal and functional
- Test edge cases
- Handle errors explicitly
